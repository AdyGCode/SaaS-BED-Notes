# Session 02 Exercises & Journals 


## Journal Entry: Summarise the Session's Content

For this week's journal we would like you to do the following...

Be honest with yourself as to what you did and did not understand. 

## Reflection Questions for Journal Entry

Here are some questions to reflect upon.

**Question:** If you executed the command `php artisan make:model Fish -msf` what files would be created?

**Question:** What is the purpose of XDebug?

**Question:** What features does XDebug bring to you as a PHP Developer?

## Research

Identify (without using Adrian Gould's Diigo account) an example of each of the following:

	- Tutorial on creating (Update/Create) Request classes for data validation
	- Tutorial on creating APIs with Laravel
	- Tutorial on testing with PEST
	- Tutorial on using Postman when developing APIs

Read through each tutorial, and summarise key points for each one.

## Out Of Class Learning

Finish the [Pest From Scratch](https://laracasts.com/series/pest-from-scratch)  (<https://laracasts.com/series/pest-from-scratch>) free course on Pest and Pest v2. 

Total video time is approximately 1hr 45min. 

Once completed summarise your learning in the journal as a separate post.


## Found a Problem?
 
If you spotted any problems (including missing details) in notes or other materials, then make sure you note that, and as a big help to your lecturer, you could fork the notes repository, create an issue, create a fix to the issue, and submit a pull request.
