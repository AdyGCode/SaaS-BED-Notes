Given the following attached lesson plan, we are to produce a suitable set of lesson slides with presenter notes to cover the content within the document.

We will need:
- References (with URLs for web based references) to resources that related to the topics
- Code examples to demonstrate the principles
- Mermaid diagrams to assist in understanding
- Step by step instructions (with detail) for any practical learning (guided)
- Core steps (without precise detail) for student activities
- Terminology summary table for any term introduced within the lesson
- A mini project for demonstration of the principle (this will be expanded during subsequent sessions)
- Details for a suitable summary activity for the end of the session
- Other suitable activities for out of class learning and practice, with details of what is required

Remember that the lesson is conducted using Laragon for provision of the services such as web server, PHP, MariaDB, Redis et al. 

The technology used is PHP, Laravel 12, Postman (or an equivalent), Windows 11, git, the Bash terminal that is available with a git installation, and we will use SQLite for development and training.

Produce the presentation using Markdown, and the Slid-dev markdown presentation structure.

Expand and add details to each slide as "presenter notes" to give more 
explanatory information as to what is being delivered adn its significance.

The presenter notes should be enclosed in <!-- and -->.

Also, make sure that all terms are summarised and an external reference is provided (not wikipedia).

The student activity should be expanded, and perhaps contain some challenges and/or reflection questions on the activity.

Make sure the guided section has code samples, and besides the array return, hint at industry standards for returning JSON data from RESTR requests.

Once complete, create a downloadable zip file containing:
- a starter repo (Laravel 12 with SQLite + Course/Student skeleton, API Resources, Pest tests),
- the slide content as a markdown file
