# Setting Up Pest in Laravel 11

## Install Pest

Quite often Pest is installed as part of the creation of the base application. But you may ensure it is by using:

  ```bash
  composer require pestphp/pest --dev
  composer require pestphp/pest-plugin-laravel --dev
  ```

Pest is only needed in development situations, and that will include the CI/CD testing process.

## Configure Pest

  - Run `php artisan pest:install` to set up Pest in your Laravel project.
  - This command will create a `tests` directory with example tests.

# Writing Your First Test
## Create a Test File

  - Navigate to the `tests/Feature` directory.
  - Create a new test file, e.g., `UserTest.php`.

You may also do this using:

```shell
php artisan make:test UserTest
```
## Write a Failing Test

  ```php
  use App\Models\User;
  use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;

  uses(RefreshDatabase::class);

  it('can create a user', function () {
      $response = $this->post('/api/users', [
          'name' => 'John Doe',
          'email' => 'john@example.com',
          'password' => 'password',
      ]);

      $response->assertStatus(201);
      $this->assertDatabaseHas('users', [
          'email' => 'john@example.com',
      ]);
  });
  ```

# Implementing the Code

## Create a Route

  ```php
  // routes/api.php
  Route::post('/users', [UserController::class, 'store']);
  ```

## Create a Controller

  ```php
  php artisan make:controller UserController
  ```

## Implement the Controller Method

  ```php
  // app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php
  namespace App\Http\Controllers;

  use App\Models\User;
  use Illuminate\Http\Request;

  class UserController extends Controller
  {
      public function store(Request $request)
      {
          $request->validate([
              'name' => 'required',
              'email' => 'required|email|unique:users',
              'password' => 'required',
          ]);

          $user = User::create([
              'name' => $request->name,
              'email' => $request->email,
              'password' => bcrypt($request->password),
          ]);

          return response()->json($user, 201);
      }
  }
  ```

# Running the Test

## Run the Test

  ```bash
  php artisan test
  ```

## Check the Output

  - Ensure the test passes. 
  - If it fails, debug the code and rerun the test.

# Refactoring

## Improve the Code

  - Refactor the code to improve readability, performance, or maintainability.
  - Ensure the tests still pass after refactoring.

# Writing More Tests

## Test Different Scenarios

Write tests for different scenarios, such as validation errors, duplicate emails, etc.

  ```php
  it('validates user data', function () {
      $response = $this->post('/api/users', [
          'name' => '',
          'email' => 'invalid-email',
          'password' => '',
      ]);

      $response->assertStatus(422);
      $response->assertJsonValidationErrors(['name', 'email', 'password'], null); 
      // Thank you to Alex J for pointing out the null parameter being needed
  });

  it('does not allow duplicate emails', function () {
      User::factory()->create(['email' => 'john@example.com']);

      $response = $this->post('/api/users', [
          'name' => 'John Doe',
          'email' => 'john@example.com',
          'password' => 'password',
      ]);

      $response->assertStatus(422);
      $response->assertJsonValidationErrors(['email'], null);
      // Thank you to Alex J for pointing out the null parameter being needed
  });
```

# Continuous Integration
## Set Up CI/CD

Integrate your tests with a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) to automatically run tests on every commit.
