# High Level Tenents

**These are the high level tenets of good API design:**

- Approach design collaboratively
- Maintain internal consistency
- When possible, use an established convention

# General Overview of Design/Implementation

In general the development process is summarised as:
## 1. Initial Request/Brief
- **Understand Requirements**: Clearly define the purpose and scope of the API. Understand the business logic, data models, and expected user interactions.
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Engage with stakeholders to gather detailed requirements and expectations.

## 2. Planning and Design
- **API Specification**: Use tools like Swagger/OpenAPI to define your API endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication methods.
- **Resource-Oriented Design**: Structure your API around resources (e.g., `/users`, `/posts`). Each resource should have standard CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- **Versioning**: Implement versioning in your API to manage changes and backward compatibility (e.g., `/v1/users`).
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Decide on the authentication method (e.g., JWT, OAuth) and define roles and permissions.
- **Error Handling**: Plan for standardized error responses with meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages.

## 3. Implementation
- **Project Setup**:
  - Install Laravel 11 using Composer.
  - Set up your database and configure the `.env` file.
- **Routing**:
  - Define routes in `routes/api.php`.
  - Use resource routing for standard CRUD operations.
- **Controllers**:
  - Create controllers for each resource.
  - Implement methods for handling requests (e.g., `index`, `store`, `show`, `update`, `destroy`).
- **Models**:
  - Define Eloquent models for your database tables.
  - Use relationships to define associations between models.
- **Requests**:
  - Use form requests for validation (e.g., `php artisan make:request StoreUserRequest`).
  - Define validation rules and custom error messages.
- **Responses**:
  - Return JSON responses with appropriate HTTP status codes.
  - Use transformers or resources to format responses consistently.
- **Middleware**:
  - Implement middleware for authentication, rate limiting, and other cross-cutting concerns.
- **Services**:
  - Use service classes to encapsulate business logic and keep controllers thin.

## 4. Testing
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Write unit tests for individual components (e.g., models, services).
  - Use PHPUnit for testing.
- **Feature Tests**:
  - Write feature tests to ensure endpoints work as expected.
  - Use Laravel’s testing tools to simulate API requests and assert responses.
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test the integration between different parts of your application.
  - Ensure that data flows correctly between controllers, services, and models.
- **Load Testing**:
  - Use tools like Apache JMeter or Artillery to test the performance of your API under load.
- **Security Testing**:
  - Test for common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, CSRF).
  - Use tools like OWASP ZAP for security testing.

## 5. Documentation
- **API Documentation**:
  - Generate and maintain up-to-date API documentation using tools like Scribe, Swagger or Postman.
  - Include examples of requests and responses, authentication details, and error codes.
- **Code Documentation**:
  - Document your code with comments and PHPDoc annotations.
  - Maintain a README file with setup instructions, environment requirements, and deployment steps.

## 6. Deployment and Maintenance
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**:
  - Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment.
  - Use tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins.
- **Monitoring and Logging**:
  - Implement logging to capture errors and important events.
  - Use monitoring tools like New Relic, Datadog, or ELK stack to monitor API performance and health.
- **Scalability**:
  - Design your API to scale horizontally.
  - Use load balancers and containerization (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) for scalability.

## 7. Feedback and Iteration
- **User Feedback**:
  - Collect feedback from API consumers to identify areas for improvement.
- **Iterative Development**:
  - Continuously improve and iterate on your API based on feedback and changing requirements.
