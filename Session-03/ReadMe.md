## Note

Remember that AI Generated Code is not 100% reliable, and as such you should check all code that is generated.

We **extremely strongly** advise that you write your test cases and your code by hand until such time as you are familiar with and able to explain your code without assistance from any AI or system such as Grammarly.

This session's notes were developed with the assistance of Mistral AI, and other resources. These include:
