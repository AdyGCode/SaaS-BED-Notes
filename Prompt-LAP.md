Using the unit of competency from https://training.gov.au/Training/Details/ICTPRG553, develop a 10 week learning and assessment plan covering all the elements, criteria, foundation skills, performance and knowledge evidence.

Each session must include suggested content - including required learning topics, knowledge, and practical skills. 

The Learning and Assessment Plan should also identify identifying three or four learning outcomes based on blooms taxonomy for each session. 

Identify when the following assessments will be conducted:

- Knowledge based assessment (a 20-30 Question quiz)
- Portfolio of work (2 parts)
- An in class coding assessment (2-3 hours in duration)
- A summative project 

Note that the summative project may have an expected completion date 5 weeks AFTER the 10 week schedule.

The Learning will use Laravel, PHP, and MariaDB.


Make sure that the LAP includes:
- the use of PEST for testing the api
- add knowledge keywords that will be covered each week,
- identify at least two activities to be performed by the students each week for both in-class and out of class study,
- compare and contrast different documentation methods for Laravel REST API, 
- ensure GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE and OPTIONS are covered.
- ensure that CORS and other required security features are also covered.

Within the elements column of the LAP template, add mapping to performance criteria or foundation skills.

You have a starter point but requires a major update.
