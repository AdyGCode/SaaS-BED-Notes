# Development Environment

Please make sure you check the required [development environment](S01-Development-Environments.md) details.

# Application Programming Interface

|     |             |
| --- | ----------- |
| **A**   | Application |
| **P**   | Programming |
| **I**   | Interface   |

A method of communicating between two different systems or parts of a system.

A 'translator' of data to allow communication between two points

---

#  Examples where APIs are used

- Hardware (Drivers provide an API for the developer) 
- Operating Systems (APIs to interact with the OS)
- Applications (APIs to interact and extend)
- Web Services (Google, Facebook, GitHub, â€¦)
- â€¦

---

# API Types

- REST
- GraphQL
- SOAP
- gRPC

> Question: Are there others?

# API Types: REST

|        | ![](Rest-API-Logo@1x.svg) |
| ------ | -------------------------------- |
| **Re** | Representational                 |
| **S**  | State                            |
| **T**  | Transfer                         |

Concept was first presented in 2000 by Roy Fielding

Data usually transferred as JSON

# REST: Six Guiding Principles

Constraints/principles to promote simplicity, scalability, and statelessness in the design.

1. Uniform Interface
2. Client-Server
3. Stateless
4. Cacheable
5. Layered System
6. Code on Demand (Optional)

- Gupta, L. (2019, June 5). _REST Principles and Architectural Constraints â€“ REST API Tutorial_. Restfulapi.net. <https://restfulapi.net/rest-architectural-constraints/>

---

# Stateless

- Requests are not bound to a single server
- No knowledge of the previous request(s)
- State not stored in application 
- Client takes care of tracking state

An API where each client request contains all the necessary information needed to process the request and the the application does not maintain any session state of context information between requests.

## Making stateless 'stateful'

e.g. shopping cart

- identify state of application
- store state in database/cache 
- include session id / cookie for correct cart access

The API is designed to be stateless

---

# REST API

> A REST API consists of an assembly of interlinked resources.
> 
> This set of resources is known as the REST APIâ€™s _**resource model**_.

---

# REST Resources

Any information that we can name can be a **resource**.

We will know the state of the resource:

- at any particular time
- **resource representation** made of:
	- the **data**, 
	- the **metadata**, & 
	- the **hypermedia links** 



---

## Resource Identifiers

- Identify each resource involved in interaction between the client and the server components.

---

## Hypermedia

- The data format of a representation is known as a media type
- The media type identifies a specification that defines how a representation is to be processed.

---

## Self-Descriptive

- **Resource representations shall be self-descriptive**
	- The client does not need to know what the resource is. 
	- Client should act based on the resource's media type.

---

# Naming API Endpoints

- Use Nouns (Fruit, Cart, User)
- Lower Case! (fruit, cart, user)
- Pluralise! (fruit, carts, usersâ€¦)
- No Verbs (get, put, saveâ€¦)
- Prepend with `api`
- Prepend with version, eg `v1`
- Use **correct/appropriate** HTTP Method
- Kebab style (use hyphens between words is needed)

| BAD                     | Good                              | HTTP      |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------- |
| `getUsers`              | `/api/v1/users`                   | GET       |
| `getUserById`           | `/api/v1users/{id}`               | GET       |
| `getUsersV1`            | `/api/v1/users`                   | GET       |
| `store-inventory`       | `/api/v2/inventories`             | POST      |
| `updateUserByID`        | `/api/v1/users/{id}`              | PUT/PATCH |
| `removeProductFromCart` | `/api/v2/cart/{cart_id}/product/` | DELETE    |

## REST & Resource Methods

**Resource methods** are used to perform the desired transition between two resource states.

No specification as to what we use for methods, could be:

- GET, POST, PATCH,â€¦
- GET, SAVE, CHANGE,â€¦

Resource methods **do not directly relate to** the HTTP methods (i.e., GET/PUT/POST/DELETE)

---

##  REST and HTTP are not the Same

Many people prefer to compare HTTP with REST. 

**REST and HTTP are not the same.**

> **REST != HTTP**

Aside: Often the HTTP methods are used due to familiarity.

---

# HTTP Request & Structure

> **All** the lines end with a carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF)

- A request line to get a required resource (e.g. GET /content/page1.html)
- Headers (e.g. Accept-Language: EN)
- An empty line (must contain ONLY CR & LF)
- A message body (optional)

_What Is an HTTP Request_. (n.d.). Sematext. <https://sematext.com/glossary/http-requests/>

---

# HTTP Verbs

- GET
- POST
- PUT
- PATCH
- DELETE
- OPTIONS

---

# HTTP Request Response

Basic response from the server contains:

- HTTP Status Code (e.g. HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently)
- Headers (e.g. Content-Type: html)
- An empty line
- A message body (optional)

> **All** the lines end with a carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF)

---

# HTTP Status/Response Codes

- **[1xx: Informational](https://restfulapi.net/http-status-codes/#1xx)** â€“ Communicates transfer protocol-level information.
- **[2xx: Success](https://restfulapi.net/http-status-codes/#2xx)** â€“ Indicates that the clientâ€™s request was accepted successfully.
- **[3xx: Redirection](https://restfulapi.net/http-status-codes/#3xx)** â€“ Indicates that the client must take some additional action in order to complete their request.
- **[4xx: Client Error](https://restfulapi.net/http-status-codes/#4xx)** â€“ This category of error status codes points the finger at clients.
- **[5xx: Server Error](https://restfulapi.net/http-status-codes/#5xx)** â€“ The server takes responsibility for these error status codes.
