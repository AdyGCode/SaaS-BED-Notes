# Session 02 Reflection Exercises 

Use the personal journal and answer the following questions that are related to what you already know from previous studies including MVC, Authentication, Authorisation, Testing and so forth.

These questions are here to help you provide evidence that you understand the content, and are developing the skills and knowledge to create APIs and NoSQL Solutions.

Answers to the questions should be written in your own terms, be at least a sentence long, and have a corresponding reference.

## Out Of Class Learning

Complete the [Pest From Scratch](https://laracasts.com/series/pest-from-scratch)  (<https://laracasts.com/series/pest-from-scratch>) free course on Pest and Pest v2. 

Total video time is approximately 1hr 45min. 

### Reflection Questions

Reflect on what you have learned previously and what you understand now, answering each question in turn.

- What does Validation mean to a SaaS developer?
- What are the two primary types of validation?
- What kinds of validation does Laravel provide to the SaaS developer?
- What benefits does data validation bring to the SaaS developer and user?
- What does Authentication mean to the developer and user of a SaaS application?
- There are a number of "out of the box" Authentication methods available, which include Password, Multi-Factor and Token-Based. What do these terms mean?
- When and why would each of these methods be used in an application?
- What features of the Laravel (version 11 or later) ecosystem provides these methods?
- Why would you use a system such as x-debug when developing a SaaS?
- What is a Laravel Request Class and how are they useful?
- What is a PEST test? 
- Why would PEST test be useful?
- Would PEST tests totally replace Unit Tests, and why?
- If we create a Generalised Response Class - we could add a "success" field set to false. Why or why not would this be a good idea?
- Consider how you may be able to use the API codebase to help develop a web application so that code would not be duplicated.
- How could you use GitHub workflows to automatically generate the Scribe documentation on push/pull request?
- How could you write the code in your controller methods so that if nothing was retrieved, you returned a `404` not found response?

## Found a Problem?
 
If you spotted any problems (including missing details) in notes or other materials, then make sure you note that, and as a big help to your lecturer, you could fork the notes repository, create an issue, create a fix to the issue, and submit a pull request.
