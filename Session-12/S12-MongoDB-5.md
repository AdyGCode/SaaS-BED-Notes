## MongoDB Practice Exercises

Use either `mongodbsh`, MongoDB Atlas, or MongoDB Compass (or equivalent) to practice using MongoDB.

All exercises **MUST** be completed using the MongoDB Shell CLI **ONLY**.

### Setting Up

Create a Markdown document, with the following starter content:

```text
# Session 12 MongoDB Exercises

Answers by YOUR_NAME_HERE

---

```

Each time you answer a question, create a heading and title as shown here:

```text
## Question X - Title

Optionally summarise the question, or copy it to here.

### Solution

	```js
		db.collection_name.find();
	```
```

These are the same as the question titles in this document, but at a level 2 (##) not level 3 (###) markdown heading. 

The answer is contained in a code block, as shown above. Important is that code blocks actually start at the beginning of the line.
