## Reflection Questions & Exercises

The following questions and exercises are to be used as revision... some may not be answered this session, but by the end of the following session the knowledge should be there to complete these.

Questions require code that would be run in the MongoDB CLI.

You will find a series of exercises in [S12 MongoDB 5 - Exercises](Session-12/S12-MongoDB-5.md) for you to work through.
