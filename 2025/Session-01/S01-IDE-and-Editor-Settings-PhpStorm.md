# IDEs, Editors and Configurations

We expect students to use the JetBrains software, PhpStorm for the SaaS clusters.

You may use another IDeE but no assistance will be provided with the IDEs configuration or use.

We would, though, appreciate contributions to these notes for recommended configurations for other editors such as VSCode, NetBeans and so forth. 

Please use this document as the template for these contributions.
