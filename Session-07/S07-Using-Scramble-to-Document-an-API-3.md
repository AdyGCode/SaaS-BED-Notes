# Session 07 Scramble Part 3

To date we have been creating an API using Scramble to document the API.

In this set of notes we are extending this to include Testing via PEST testing.

## Configuration

Before you continue, you **must** do some configuration for testing to work.

If you **DO NOT** configure the testing correctly, then the tests are run on the LIVE database. Not a good diea.

Firstly we either configure PHPUnit.xml **or** we create a `.env.testing` file.


### Option 1: PhpUnit.xml

Locate and open the PhpUnit.xml file.

Find the following two lines and uncomment them...

```xml
<!-- <env name="DB_CONNECTION" value="sqlite"/> -->
<!-- <env name="DB_DATABASE" value=":memory:"/> -->
```

so they become:

```xml
<env name="DB_CONNECTION" value="sqlite"/>
<env name="DB_DATABASE" value=":memory:"/>
```

_Alternatively..._

### Option 2: Create `.env.testing`

Duplicate the `.env` making the new copy `.env.testing`

Update the new file so that you make the database use SQLite as in-`:memory:` database.

```ini

DB_CONNECTION=sqlite 
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=:memory: 
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```



### test/Pest.php

Edit the `test/Pest.php` file and update so it reads:

```php
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;
use Tests\TestCase;

pest()
    ->extend(TestCase::class)
    ->extend(RefreshDatabase::class)
    ->in('Feature');
```

This change will clean the database and re-run any migrations every time a test is executed.




## Testing all Routes

Original version: https://magecomp.com/blog/test-all-routes-in-laravel-with-pest/

Our first test will be to create a Route Test that tests all routes.

```shell
php artisan make:test RouteTest --pest
```

Edit this test and add:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Artisan;
use Illuminate\Testing\TestResponse;

it('has a working response for all routes', function () {
    // Retrieve all routes
    $routes = collect(Route::getRoutes())->map(function ($route) {
        return [
            'uri' => $route->uri(),
            'methods' => $route->methods(),
        ];
    });

    // Iterate over each route
    foreach ($routes as $route) {
        foreach ($route['methods'] as $method) {
            $response = $this->call($method, $route['uri']);
            
            // Check if the response is successful
            $response->assertStatus(200);
        }
    }
});

```
