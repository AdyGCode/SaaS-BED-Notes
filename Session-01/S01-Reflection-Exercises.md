There are NO Reflection Questions for this session.

### Found a Problem?
 
If you spotted any problems (including missing details) in notes or other materials, then make sure you note that, and as a big help to your lecturer, you could fork the notes repository, create an issue, create a fix to the issue, and submit a pull request.
