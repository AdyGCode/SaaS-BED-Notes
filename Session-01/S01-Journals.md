# What are they?

Journals are:

- **private to you and the lecturer(s) for the cluster**
- your way of documenting your learning
- your way to show research conducted during learning
- your way of showing active participation
- your way to reflect on the content

They *are* a part of the assessed work you will complete for the cluster.

---

# Why we are using them

We are using the journals as a way to:

- Develop a **reflective learning attitude**
	- This allows you to prove you are involved in your learning
	- This also provides a way for you to ask yourself questions
- Develop your **research and documentation skills**
- Develop an **investigative mindset**


---

# Your Commitments

You are required to:

- Check each session's Reflection Exercises and complete the content.
- There are no length requirements, but a blank or very short journal may be looked at negatively.

---

# How to Create a Journal Entry

- Open Blackboard
- Go to the cluster shell
- Click on the "journal" link on the side, or on the welcome page
- Click create new entry
- Type your journal entry into the page
- Save the journal

---

# What to Include on a Journal Entry

There are many things that you could include on a journal entry.

Most sessions will indicate what is needed.

All entries should:

- Answer the reflection questions when posed
- Contain meaningful in their content
- Use MyBib ([https://mybib.com]) to create Bibliographic entries for Books, Web Sites, Videos, and other references
