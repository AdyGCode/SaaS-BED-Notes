# Session 03 Reflection Exercises 

## Complete the in class exercises

If you have not done so, please complete the in-class exercises that are contained in the notes.

## Tutorial

Make sure you cover the following tutorial on TDD and REST APIs - it covers the subject again, providing you with an alternative workflow, which makes a great deal of sense.

Rosas, A. (2021, October 14). _Building an API using TDD in Laravel | Laravel.io_. Laravel.io. https://laravel.io/articles/building-an-api-using-tdd-in-laravel
